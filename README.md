<h3>
 This script does the following:
<ol>
  <li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set assigned to <em>df (dim=10299x563)</em></li>
  <li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, <em>dfMeanStd (dim=10299x88)</em>
  <li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
  <li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, <em>by replacing the abbrevations with the full names</em></li>
  <li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject <em>dfGroup (dim=180x88)</em></li>
</ol>
